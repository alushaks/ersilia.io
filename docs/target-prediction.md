# Drug target prediction

Drug target predictions is one of the most relevant tasks in drug discovery. In this example, we showcase the use of a simple model provided by the ChEMBL chemogenomics database.

## A simple, ligand-based model

In our model hub,

```python
from ersilia import ErsiliaModel
em = ErsiliaModel("xxxx")
```

## Run predictions
