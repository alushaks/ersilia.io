# Gemma Turon Rodrigo

Co-founder and Project Manager

> Trained as a Molecular Biologist, my previous research has been focused on the field of cancer and stem cells. I am now committed to use my expertise in the implementation of tools that support equitable drug discovery and global health development. I combine my passion for science and my career as a circus artist and trainer.
