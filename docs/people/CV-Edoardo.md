# Edoardo Gaude

Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer

> I am a Science Entrepreneur with a background in Biochemistry and Diagnostics. My main interest is to develop healthcare academic research into impact innovations. My current focus includes diagnostics applications for large patient populations and therapeutics solutions for low and middle income countries. My free time is generally spent exploring the great outdoors.
