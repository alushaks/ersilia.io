### Edoardo Gaude

Edoardo is motivated in making an impact by applying his expertise to real-world medical needs. After a PhD in oncology at the University of Cambridge, Edoardo took on a clinical scientist position at Owlstone Medical Ltd (Cambridge, UK). In 2018, he founded POCKiT diagnostics Ltd, a medical company aimed at improving stroke care. During his academic and industrial career, he published ~40 scientific articles, filed 3 patents, designed and performed several clinical studies, and contributed to raising £1.2M public and private funds. With Ersilia, Edoardo aims to harness his science entrepreneurship expertise for the creation and furthering of open innovation and science crowdsourcing. He is extremely excited to witness how this approach will transform the drug discovery field.

### Gemma Turon

Trained as a molecular biologist, Gemma completed a PhD in colorectal cancer and stem cells at IRB Barcelona. Her interests, though, span a broad range of topics, with a special interest in global health and neglected diseases. This led her to move, recently, to Zambia and Palestine, to cooperate with local social circus NGOs, her other passion. These stays have given her insight on how to work and implement programs in emerging economies. With Ersilia, Gemma hopes to bring together her scientific knowledge and her social work to deliver high-quality, fast services that will effectively tackle some of the most urgent health issues in developing countries.

### Miquel Duran-Frigola

Miquel’s research interests lay at the intersection between drug discovery and large-scale biological data analysis. During his PhD studies and early career, Miquel developed state-of-the-art in silico methods, producing scientific publications in a broad range of topics, from theoretical chemistry to phenotypic screening. Along this process, he has worked at IRB Barcelona, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tel Aviv University, ISGlobal-CISM (Mozambique) and CIDRZ (Zambia). With Ersilia, Miquel aims to apply his expertise to the context of open science and global health, accelerating the discovery of treatments for neglected clinical needs.
