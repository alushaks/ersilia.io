Trained as a molecular biologist, Gemma completed a PhD in colorectal cancer and stem cells at IRB Barcelona. Her interests, though, span a broad range of topics, with a special interest in global health and neglected diseases. This led her to move, recently, to Zambia and Palestine, to cooperate with local social circus NGOs, her other passion. These stays have given her insight on how to work and implement programs in emerging economies. With Ersilia, Gemma hopes to bring together her scientific knowledge and her social work to deliver high-quality, fast services that will effectively tackle some of the most urgent health issues in developing countries.
