Miquelâ€™s research interests lay at the intersection between drug discovery and large-scale biological data analysis. During his PhD studies and early career, Miquel developed state-of-the-art *in silico* methods, producing scientific publications in a broad range of topics, from theoretical chemistry to phenotypic screening. Along this process, he has worked at IRB Barcelona, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tel Aviv University, ISGlobal-CISM (Mozambique) and CIDRZ (Zambia). With Ersilia, Miquel aims to apply his expertise to the context of open science and global health, accelerating the discovery of treatments for neglected clinical needs.
