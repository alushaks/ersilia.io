### Top performance in the CTD-squared Pan-Cancer Activity DREAM Challenge!

[Dream challenges](http://dreamchallenges.org/) are an exciting way to connect researchers and let them focus, collaboratively, on relevant a research question. Previous DREAM Challenges include computational prediction of synergistic drug combinations or analysis of gene expression data from *Plasmodium falciparum*. For a data scientist, a great thing about participating in a DREAM Challenge is the access to highly valuable, well prepared datasets, and the existence of a clear research question. Doesn't happen too often.

A year ago, when we were finishing up the [Chemical Checker](http://bioactivitysignatures.org) at IRB Barcelona, the [CTD-squared Pan-Cancer Drug Activity](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20968331/wiki/597042) DREAM Challenge was published. The exercise was attractive: the targets of 30 incognito drugs were to be identified based on post-treatment transcriptional data across 11 cell lines.

We felt that such a challenge could be a good external validation for our bioactivity signatures which include transcriptional data for compounds. We self-imposed the contraint to use very simple computational methods because, for us, it was important to evaluate the power of Chemical Checker signatures as drop-in replacements for conventional chemical descriptors, not to develop yet another AI algorithm. [Here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21553207/wiki/600925) you can find a writeup of the methodology: shamefully simple, indeed, mere similarity searches and little more.

As it turns out, our predictions were top performing. We were invited by the DREAM Challenge organizers to participate in the writing of the corresponding paper which, we learned, had a particular focus on kinases. Today this paper is released as a preprint. A great example of crowd-sourced research and, we hope, an important contribution to kinase-based cancer therapies.
