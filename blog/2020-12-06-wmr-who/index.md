### Snapshot of the malaria status worldwide
One week ago the WHO released the 2020 edition of the [World Malaria Report] (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015791), analyzing the disease situation and the accomplishments of the last decade in the race to eradicate it. Find more about it with our digest:
*Location* 94% of malaria cases happen within the African Region, specially affecting Nigeria, the DRC, Uganda, Mozambique and Niger.
*Achievements* Current strategies have managed to avert 7.6 million deaths due to malaria in the period 2000-2019, but they have not been able to revert the trend and the malaria incidence keeps moving away from the milestones set in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030.
*Funding* The gap between invested funds and needed resources has grown non-stop, reaching an astounding 2.6$ million. Major funders include the US (35%), Malaria Endemic Countries (31%) and the UK (10%).
*Resistance* Although resistance to artemisinin-based therapy has only posed a threat in the Mekong region, most malaria endemic countries do report insecticide resistance to the most common insecticide classes. This hampers the efficiency of vector control, one of the best tools to fight malaria spread.
*SARS-Cov2* The SARS-Cov2 pandemic has disrupted malaria treatment worldwide, and many countries have had to adapt malaria prevention plans to the pandemic restrictions, limiting their reach. The WHO has coordinated a global effort to continue the production and distribution of malaria tests and drugs, but they estimate that only a 10% disruption in service will lead to 19000 extra deaths in sub saharan africa

In summary, major advances have been made in the eradication of malaria, but the efforts have reached a plateau since 2015. A global effort is now more than ever needed to take advantage of the implemented solutions and achieve the 2030 GTS goals (citing from [WHO](https://www.who.int/malaria/areas/global_targets/en/)):
- To reduce malaria mortality rate by 90% (compared to 2015)
- To reduce malaria case incidence by 90% (compared to 2015)
- To eliminate malaria from at least 35 malaria endemic countries
- To prevent re-establishment of malaria in all Member States currently malaria-free
