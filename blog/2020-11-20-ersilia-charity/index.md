#### Ersilia, a charitable project
Ersilia Open Source Initiative has been formally recognized as a Charity by the England and Wales Charity commission. You can find us [here](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/5170657/charity-overview).
With this, we have achieved our first milestone, to be recognized by the community as an organization that works towards the public benefit. Our purpose is to provide the scientific community with an open-source platform that leverages the machine learning potential to aid in the drug discovery process, lowering the barrier for the development of new treatments. We are focused on developing models for  infectious diseases, which still represent over 60% of the disease burden in Low and Middle Income Countries, by establishing partnerships with researchers from these areas and strengthening their research capacity. We, EOS Initiative co-founders, hope to contribute to a more egalitarian Health system, with guaranteed access to treatment regardless of disease or geographic location.
