This week the Ersilia team has had the pleasure of participating in the second JROST conference (Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools), an initiative by [Invest in Open Infrastructure](www.investinopen.org). Aside from presenting our project, we had a chance to find more about great open sciences initiatives. If you are interested, stay tuned because the online sessions will be released in January!
In this blogpost, we want to emphasize the need for an open, collaborative and reproducible research, core values to our mission. In [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) you will find an invaluable resource to make sure your research is reusable at the end of the day! The key points in FAIR data research, outlined in the handbook, are:
**Reproducibility** reproducible research (a different team produces the same results by using the same dataset and code as the original one) increases results reliability, facilitates collaboration and ensures continuity of the scientific process.
**Openness** open research includes research that is made publicly available, reusable and transparent. This includes, but is not limited to, appropriate licensing, clear data citation, open source publications and use of open source software
When developing a data science project, we must ask ourselves the following questions: What software are we going to use? Which computational environment are we working with? Where is our data going to be stored, and how will it be findable and citable? Which licenses will apply to the code/data/software we produce? What collaborative tools, if any, are we going to use?

Clarifying these points will be key for the successful planification of an Open Science Data project. We ourselves at Ersilia are revisiting these ideas everyday to make sure we stay as open as possible. I encourage you to have a look (and contribute!) to the Turing Way Handbook :)
